This used to be a working soup.io dumper.

It's not overly clever (especially the caching behaviour), but I managed to
save about a year's worth of posts from our rather busy soup. I believe the 
page design changed, so the scraping doesn't work properly anymore, I hope
I find the time to fix this before soup.io goes down (rumored to be rather 
soonish)
